## System Performance

The system performance was tested using a 2.7GHz Intel Core i7 16GB MacBook Pro using 3.2M US patent abstracts from approximately 2005 to 2018. Indicatively, it initially takes about 6 hours to produce a specially optimised 100,000 term TFIDF Dictionary with a file size under 100MB. Once this is created however, it takes approximately 1 minute to run a pyGrams popular terminology query, or approximately 7 minutes for an emerging terminology query.

<a id="basic-use"> </a>

## Basic use

pyGrams is command line driven, and called in the following manner:

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py
```

<a id="input-text-data"> </a>

### Input Text Data

#### Selecting the document source (-ds)

This argument is used to select the corpus of documents to analyse. The default source is a pre-created random 1,000 patent dataset from the USPTO, `USPTO-random-1000.pkl.bz2`. 

Pre-created datasets of 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and 500,000 patents are available in the `./data` folder:

- ```USPTO-random-100.pkl.bz2```
- ```USPTO-random-1000.pkl.bz2```
- ```USPTO-random-10000.pkl.bz2```
- ```USPTO-random-100000.pkl.bz2```
- ```USPTO-random-500000.pkl.bz2```

For example, to load the 10,000 pickled dataset for patents, use:

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -ds=USPTO-random-10000.pkl.bz2
```

To use your own document dataset, please place in the `./data` folder of pyGrams. File types currently supported are:

- pkl.bz2: compressed pickle file containing a dataset
- xlsx: new Microsoft excel format
- xls: old Microsoft excel format
- csv: comma separated value file (with headers)

Datasets should contain the following columns:

|Column			    |      Required?      |        Comments           |
|:---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------:|
|Free text field   |       Yes           | Terms extracted from here |
|Date              |       Optional      | Compulsory for emergence  |
|Other headers     |       Optional      | Can filter by content     |

#### Selecting the column header names (-th, -dh)

When loading a document dataset, you will need to provide the column header names for each, using:

- `-th`: free text field column (default is 'text')
- `-dh`: date column (default is 'date', format is 'YYYY/MM/DD')

For example, for a corpus of book blurbs you could use:

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -th='blurb' -dh='published_date'
```

#### Using cached files to speed up processing (-uc)

In order save processing time, at various stages of the pipeline, we cache data structures that are costly and slow to compute, like the compressed tf-idf matrix, the timeseries matrix, the smooth series and its derivatives from kalman filter and others:

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -uc all-mdf-0.05-200501-201841
```

<a id="tfidf"> </a>

### TFIDF Dictionary

#### N-gram selection (-mn, -mx)

An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram)). N-grams can be unigrams (single words, e.g., vehicle), bigrams (sequences of two words, e.g., aerial vehicle), trigrams (sequences of three words, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle) or any n number of continuous terms. 

The following arguments will set the n-gram limit to be, e.g. unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams (the default):

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -mn=1 -mx=3
```

To analyse only unigrams:

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -mn=1 -mx=1
```

#### Maximum document frequency (-mdf)

Terms identified are filtered by the maximum number of documents that use this term; the default is 0.05, representing an upper limit of 5% of documents containing this term. If a term occurs in more that 5% of documents it is rejected.

For example, to set the maximum document frequency to 5% (the default), use:

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -mdf 0.05
```

Using a small (5% or less) maximum document frequency may help remove generic words, or stop words.

#### Stopwords

There are three configuration files available inside the config directory:

- stopwords_glob.txt
- stopwords_n.txt
- stopwords_uni.txt

The first file (stopwords_glob.txt) contains stopwords that are applied to all n-grams. The second file contains stopwords that are applied to all n-grams for n > 1 (bigrams and trigrams). The last file (stopwords_uni.txt) contains stopwords that apply only to unigrams. The users can append stopwords into this files, to stop undesirable output terms.

#### Pre-filter Terms

Given that many of the terms will actually be very rare, they will not be of use when looking for popular terms.
The total number of terms can easily exceed 1,000,000 and slow down pygrams with
irrelevant terms. To circumvent this, a prefilter is applied as soon as the TFIDF matrix is created
which will retain the highest scoring terms by TFIDF (as is calculated and reported at the end of the main pipeline).
The default is to retain the top 100,000 terms; setting it to 0 will disable it, viz:

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -pt 0
```

Or changed to a different threshold such as 10,000 terms (using the longer argument name for comparison):

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -prefilter_terms 10000
```

Note that the prefilter will change TFIDF results as it will remove rare n-grams - which will
result in bi-grams & tri-grams having increased scores when rare uni-grams and bi-grams are removed, as we
unbias results to avoid double or triple counting contained n-grams.

<a id="document-filters"> </a>

### Document Filters

#### Time filters (-df, -dt)

This argument can be used to filter documents to a certain timeframe. For example, the below will restrict the document cohort to only those from 20 Feb 2000 up to now (the default start date being 1 Jan 1900).

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -dh publication_date -df=2000/02/20
```

The following will restrict the document cohort to only those between 1 March 2000 and 31 July 2016.

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -dh publication_date -df=2000/03/01 -dt=2016/07/31
```

#### Column features filters (-fh, -fb)

If you want to filter results, such as for female, British in the example below, you can specify the column names you wish to filter by, and the type of filter you want to apply, using:

- `-fh`: the list of column names (default is None)
- `-fb`: the type of filter (choices are `'union'` (default), where all fields need to be 'yes', or `'intersection'`, where any field can be 'yes') 

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -fh=['female','british'] -fb='union'
```

This filter assumes that values are '0'/'1', or 'Yes'/'No'.


#### Choosing CPC classification (Patent specific) (-cpc)

This subsets the chosen patents dataset to a particular Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) class, for example Y02. The Y02 classification is for "technologies or applications for mitigation or adaptation against climate change". An example script is:

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -cpc=Y02 -ds=USPTO-random-10000.pkl.bz2
```

In the console the number of subset patents will be stated. For example, for `python pygrams.py -cpc=Y02 -ps=USPTO-random-10000.pkl.bz2` the number of Y02 patents is 197. Thus, the TFIDF will be run for 197 patents.

<a id="term-filters"> </a>

### Term Filters

#### Search terms filter (-st)

This subsets the TFIDF term dictionary by only keeping terms related to the given search terms.

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -st pharmacy medicine chemist
```

<a id="timeseries-calculations"> </a>

### Timeseries Calculations

#### Timeseries (-ts)

An option to choose between popular or emergent terminology outputs. Popular terminology is the default option; emergent terminology can be used by typing:

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -ts
```

#### Emergence Index (-ei)

An option to choose between quadratic fitting, [Porter 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324777916_Emergence_scoring_to_identify_frontier_RD_topics_and_key_players) or gradients from state-space model using kalman filter smoothing  emergence indexes. Porter is used by default; quadratic fitting can be used instead, for example:

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -ts -ei quadratic
```

#### Exponential (-exp)

An option designed to favour exponential like emergence, based on a yearly weighting function that linearly increases from zero, for example:

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -ts -exp
```

<a id="timeseries-forecasts"> </a>

### Timeseries Forecasts

Various options are available to control how emergence is forecasted.

#### Predictor Names (-pns)

The forecast method is selected using argument pns, in this case corresponding to Linear (2=default) and Holt-Winters (6). 

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -pns=2
python pygrams.py -pns=6
```

The full list of options is included below, with multiple inputs are allowed.

0. All options
1. Naive
2. Linear
3. Quadratic
4. Cubic
5. ARIMA
6. Holt-Winters
7. LSTM-multiLA-stateful
8. LSTM-multiLA-stateless
9. LSTM-1LA-stateful
10. LSTM-1LA-stateless
11. LSTM-multiM-1LA-stateful
12. LSTM-multiM-1LA-stateless

#### Other options

number of terms to analyse (default: 25)

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -nts=25
```

minimum number of patents per quarter referencing a term (default: 15)

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -mpq=15
```

number of steps ahead to analyse for (default: 5) 

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -stp=5
```

analyse using test or not (default: False)

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -tst=False
```

analyse using normalised patents counts or not (default: False)

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -nrm=False
```

<a id="outputs"> </a>

### Outputs (-o)

Pygrams outputs a report of top ranked terms (popular or emergent). Additional command line arguments provide alternative options, for example a word cloud or 'graph summary'.

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -o wordcloud
python pygrams.py -o graph
```

Time series analysis also supports a multiplot to present up to 30 terms time series (emergent and declining), output in the `outputs/emergence` folder:

```python
# Python
python pygrams.py -ts -dh 'publication_date' -o multiplot
```

The output options generate:

- Report is a text file containing top n terms (default is 250 terms, see `-np` for more details)
- `wordcloud`: a word cloud containing top n terms (default is 250 terms, see `-nd` for more details)
- `graph`: a summary graph containing top n terms (default is 250 terms, see `-nf` for more details) linked to the most common co-located terms

Note that all outputs are generated in the `outputs` subfolder. Below are some example outputs:

#### Report

The report will output the top n number of terms (default is 250) and their associated TFIDF score. Below is an example for patent data, where only bigrams have been analysed.

|Term			                |	    TFIDF Score     |
|:------------------------- | -------------------:|
|1. fuel cell               |       2.143778      |
|2. heat exchanger          |       1.697166      |
|3. exhaust gas             |       1.496812      |
|4. combustion engine       |       1.480615      |
|5. combustion chamber      |       1.390726      |
|6. energy storage          |       1.302651      |
|7. internal combustion     |       1.108040      |
|8. positive electrode      |       1.100686      |
|9. carbon dioxide          |       1.092638      |
|10. control unit           |       1.069478      |

#### Wordcloud ('wordcloud')

A wordcloud, or tag cloud, is a novel visual representation of text data, where words (tags) importance is shown with font size and colour. Here is a [wordcloud](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencecampus/pygrams/master/outputs/wordclouds/wordcloud_tech.png) using patent data. The greater the TFIDF score, the larger the font size of the term.

#### Graph summary ('graph')

This output provides an interactive HTML graph. The graph shows connections between terms that are generally found in the same documents.

| Term                       | Connections                                                  |
