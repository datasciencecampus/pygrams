# Archived code

Note that the archived LSTM code depends on packages:
* 'keras'
* 'tensorflow'
* 'keras_tqdm'

If you wish to use this code, you will need to install these packages.

Note that the code is a copy of the original sources in the equivalent locations in the source tree; the code will need to be moved there to be used and is no longer supported.
