The tufts or strands of wool are of a first and substantially equal length and of a substantially uniform color. The pad also carries a plurality of shorter tufts of wool or other fiber of a contrasting color. When the pad is relatively new, the shorter tufts are not normally visible as they are hidden by the longer tufts. As the pad becomes worn, however, the longer tufts become shorter and matted down thereby exposing the shorter tufts. The appearance of the contrasting color of the shorter tufts is an indicator that the pad is worn and should be replaced.",[],2005-05-24

In this process, a layer of conductive material is applied over the insulator layer so that the layer of conductive material covers field regions adjacent the features and fills in the features themselves. A grain size differential between the conductive material which covers the field regions and the conductive material which fills in the features is then established by annealing the layer of conductive material. Excess conductive material is then removed to uncover the field regions and leave the conductive structures. The layer of conductive material is applied so as to define a first layer thickness over the field regions and a second layer thickness in and over the features. These thicknesses are dimensioned such that d 1 ≦0.5d 2 , with d 1  being the first layer thickness and d 2  being the second layer thickness.

The new forwarding protocol allows the remote client to conduct point-to-point link protocols, such as point-to-point protocol (PPP) and serial line interface protocol (SLIP) directly with the local network home gateway. The network access server changes from a routing mode where a communication protocol is conducted with the client to a switching mode where the POP simply sends data from one port to a tunnel. The tunnel then transmits the data to another port, regardless of the header information on transmitted data packets. The remote client can then be managed through databases controlled by the local network and gain access to resources not typically accessible through the internet. The layer two forwarding protocol conducts an independent authorization session to prevent unauthorized access to the private network and provides point-to-point protocol transport over the internet independently of internet transport protocols.","['G06F15/16', 'H04L12/56', 'H04L12/66']",2012-06-05
